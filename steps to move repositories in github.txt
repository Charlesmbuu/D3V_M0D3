Steps to Consolidate Repositories
Create a New Repository (Destination)
Go to GitHub and create your new, "fresh" repository. Do not initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or license file. You will need the new repository's HTTPS clone URL for the following steps.
Open Your Terminal or Git Bash
Create a Bare Clone of the Old Repository (Source)
Navigate to a temporary directory on your local machine and create a bare clone of the original repository. A bare clone only contains the Git history and structure, not a working directory.
bash
git clone --bare https://github.com
Replace your-username/old-repository.git with the actual URL of your old repository.
Navigate into the Cloned Directory
Change your current working directory to the newly created bare clone's folder (it will end with .git).
bash
cd old-repository.git
Mirror-Push to the New Repository
Push all the references (branches, tags, commits) from the local bare clone to the new GitHub repository using the --mirror flag.
bash
git push --mirror https://github.com
Replace your-username/new-repository.git with the clone URL of your new, empty repository.
Clean Up Locally and on GitHub
Local Cleanup: After the push is complete and successful, you can remove the temporary local bare clone directory:
bash
cd ..
rm -rf old-repository.git
GitHub Cleanup: You can now safely delete the original old-repository on GitHub if you wish, or the new repository will have automatic redirects for web links to the old one.
